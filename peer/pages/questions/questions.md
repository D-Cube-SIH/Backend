Questions
Little interest or pleasure in doing things

Feeling tired or having little energy

Poor appetite or overeating

Feeling bad about yourself — or that you are a failure or have let yourself or your family down

Trouble concentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching television

Moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed? Or the opposite — being so fidgety or restless that you have been moving around a lot more than usual

Thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way

If you checked off any problems above, how difficult have these problems made it for you to do your work, take care of things at home, or get along with other people?
